				<h1>Hi there! My name is Lee Kit</h1>
				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>I'm a student from Republic Polytechnic studying Interactive Digital & Media. I major in 3 aspects of Design: Photoshop, Illustration and Animation. My passion lies hugely on Anime and Animation. I love  drawing both digital and traditional styles. Although I'm more anime cultured, I love to broaden my creativity & come up with newer & better ideas for my art works. Iâ€™m quick-witted, free-minded and also hard-working.</p>
				
				<h2>My Career Path</h2>
				
				<p> I look forward to working with an animation company as an animator, a comics artist and a character designer. 
				Since young, my love for cartoon develops along with anime which encourages me to draw continously and never give up. Starting from my daily life of comics, to character design, illustration and learning many more through school lessons.</p>
			
				<p>My goal in life is to release my very own anime film and manga and have it well-known for its story and art style. I would love to collaborate with story artists and come up with animation ideas and film in my career path.</p>
				
				<br>

				<h2>Thank you for looking at my website! Feel free to stop by my Instagram, Facebook or drop me an Email for more :)</h2>
